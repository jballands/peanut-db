# peanut-db

This is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates how vectors databases like [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) work at an _extremely_ high-level.

Vector databases are really important to give large language models (LLMs) (like ChatGPT) "long-lived memory".

## Installation
